            Hello my name is Andrew Pel. I am currently a senior studying in the field of Computer Science. 
            I'm the captain of the intramural volleyball team called Oh Yeah and I'm also a part of the 
            ultimate frisbee team called Sauce. Other than playing ultimate frisbee and volleyball, 
            I love to dance. I am one of the founders of the dance crew called Rice Paddy Heroes!
