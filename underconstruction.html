            The purpose of the html is to serve as a temp webpage for a webpage that is currently under construction.
            I set background-size to 100% so that on all web pages the website will try to fit the image size to 100% of the screen size.
            I put the image in the same folder as html file so i dont have to search different directories for the image file.
            I also put no repeat on the image because the image would repeat itself.
